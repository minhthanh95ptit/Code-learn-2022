// You have been given a string s, which is supposed to be a sentence. However, someone forgot to put spaces between the different words, and for some reason they capitalized the first letter of every word. Return the sentence after making the following amendments:

// Put a single space between the words.
// Convert the uppercase letters to lowercase.
// Example

// For s = "CodelearnIsAwesome", the output should be
// amendTheSentence(s) = "codelearn is awesome";
// For s = "Hello", the output should be
// amendTheSentence(s) = "hello".
